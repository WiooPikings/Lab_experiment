 *** if Statements  *** 

If statements are control flow statements which helps us to run a particular code only when a certain condition is satisfied.
For example, you want to print a message on the screen only when a condition is true then you can use if statement to accomplish this in programming.
In this guide, we will learn how to use if statements in Python programming with the help of examples.

 *** Python for Statements  *** 

The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal.
Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal),
or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C),
Pythonâ€™s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string),
in the order that they appear in the sequence.

 *** Python while Statements  ***  
    
The flow of execution for a while statement works like this:
Evaluate the condition (BOOLEAN EXPRESSION), yielding False or True.
If the condition is false, exit the while statement and continue execution at the next statement.
If the condition is true, execute each of the STATEMENTS in the body and then go back to step 1.
The body consists of all of the statements below the header with the same indentation.
The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that eventually the condition becomes false and the loop terminates.
Otherwise the loop will repeat forever, which is called an infinite loop.
