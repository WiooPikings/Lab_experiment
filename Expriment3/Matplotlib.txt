Matplotlib is the most popular plotting library in python. Using matplotlib, you can create pretty much any type of plot. However, as your plots get more 
complex, the learning curve can get steeper.

The goal of this tutorial is to make you understand ‘how plotting with matplotlib works’ and make you comfortable to build full-featured 
plots with matplotlib.

The following piece of code is found in pretty much any python code that has matplotlib plots.

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib inline

matplotlib.pyplot is usually imported as plt. It is the core object that contains the methods to create all sorts of charts and features in a plot.
The %matplotlib inline is a jupyter notebook specific command that let’s you see the plots in the notbook itself.
Suppose you want to draw a specific type of plot, say a scatterplot, the first thing you want to check out are the methods under plt (type plt and hit tab or type dir(plt) in python prompt).
Let’s begin by making a simple but full-featured scatterplot and take it from there. Let’s see what plt.plot() creates if you an arbitrary sequence of numbers.

The basic steps to creating plots with matplotlib are:
1) Prepare data
2) Create plot
3) Plot
4) Customize plot
5) Save plot
6) Show plot
